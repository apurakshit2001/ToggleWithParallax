            Parallax scrolling is a web site trend where the background content (i.e. an image) is moved at a different
            speed than the foreground content while scrolling.

            What is parallax on a website?

            Parallax scrolling is used to add visual interest to a website and engage users as they scroll through a web
            page. In a parallax scrolling effect, both the foreground and background are moving, but the background
            typically moves much more slowly, giving the illusion of depth.

            Parallax scrolling can really enhance the overall user experience of a website, livening up a design with
            motion and enhancing its interactivity. When people see that scrolling doesn't move everything in one fixed
            block, but rather touches multiple elements, they feel more in control over how they experience a website.

            Nature is a captivating and awe-inspiring entity that surrounds us. Exploring nature opens up a world of
            wonder and beauty, inviting us to connect with the natural environment. It involves immersing ourselves in
            the tranquil landscapes, vibrant flora, and diverse fauna that exist on our planet. Nature exploration
            offers a respite from the hustle and bustle of daily life, allowing us to rejuvenate and find solace in its
            serenity. By exploring nature, we can gain a deeper understanding of the interconnectedness of all living
            beings and the delicate balance of ecosystems. It nurtures a sense of appreciation, fostering a desire to
            preserve and protect the natural world for future generations. Through nature exploration, we discover our
            place in the grand tapestry of life and find harmony within ourselves and the environment.
